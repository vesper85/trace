# VirtualNet

VirtualNet allows you to create forked network sessions for testing complex transaction sequences in isolation.

## Overview

VirtualNet creates a virtual copy (fork) of the Movement network, allowing you to:

- Execute multiple transactions without affecting the real network
- Fund test accounts with simulated tokens
- Review transaction history within a session
- Test complex DeFi flows or multi-step operations

## Sessions

### Creating a Session

1. Navigate to **VirtualNet** from the sidebar
2. Click **Create Session**
3. Enter a descriptive session name
4. Select the network to fork (mainnet or testnet)
5. Click **Create**

Your session is created with a unique ID and is ready for transactions.

### Managing Sessions

From the VirtualNet landing page, you can:

- View all your sessions
- See session creation time and network
- Open a session to view details
- Delete sessions you no longer need

## Executing Transactions

Within a session, you can execute transactions that modify the virtual state.

### Send Transaction

1. Open a session
2. Click **Send Transaction**
3. Enter the transaction details:
   - Contract address
   - Function to call
   - Arguments
4. Submit to execute on the virtual network

### Fund Account

Need tokens for testing? Fund any account:

1. Click **Fund Account**
2. Enter the account address
3. Specify the amount (in APT)
4. The account will receive simulated tokens

## Transaction History

Each session maintains a complete history of operations:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Index** | Order of execution |
| **Operation** | Function called or fund operation |
| **Status** | Success or failure with details |
| **Gas Used** | Gas consumed by the transaction |
| **Events** | Events emitted during execution |
| **State Changes** | Resources modified |

### Viewing Operation Details

Click on any operation card to expand:

- **Events** — All events with their data
- **Resources** — State changes with before/after values
- **Inputs** — Parameters passed to the function

### Failed Transactions

Failed operations show detailed error information:

- Error code
- Error description
- Module location where the abort occurred

## Use Cases

### Testing DeFi Interactions

```
1. Fund account with APT
2. Swap APT for USDC
3. Supply USDC to lending protocol
4. Borrow against collateral
```

Test the entire flow without risking real assets.

### Debugging Transaction Sequences

When a series of transactions fails:

1. Create a session forked at the right block
2. Replay transactions one by one
3. Identify which step fails and why

### Contract Development

Before deploying to testnet:

1. Deploy contract to VirtualNet
2. Test all entry points
3. Verify edge cases and error handling
