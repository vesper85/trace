# Overview

Welcome to **Trace** — a powerful suite of debugging and development tools for the Movement L1 blockchain.

## What is Trace?

Trace provides developers with essential tools to simulate, debug, and test smart contract transactions on the Movement network before deploying to mainnet. Built specifically for the Movement ecosystem, Trace helps you:

- **Simulate transactions** before execution to preview results and catch errors
- **Fork networks** to create isolated testing environments
- **Debug failed transactions** with detailed error messages and gas analysis
- **Inspect state changes** including events and resource modifications

## Key Features

### 🎮 Transaction Simulator

Simulate any entry or view function on Movement mainnet or testnet. See exactly what would happen without spending gas or modifying state.

- Load any contract by address
- Auto-discover modules and functions
- Preview events, state changes, and return values
- Detailed gas usage breakdown

### 🌐 VirtualNet

Create forked network sessions to test complex transaction sequences in isolation.

- Fork from mainnet or testnet at any point
- Execute multiple transactions in sequence
- Fund test accounts with simulated tokens
- Full transaction history per session
